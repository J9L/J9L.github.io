  <p> GoodHands are the Noon Government Organization that was founded by five<br>
    students from the School Of CodeFellows<br> which is located in Portland,Oregon<p>
  <p> GoodHands have many branches and our main goal is to show why we have given hands</p>
  <p> Hands are basically given to us not to just put in our pocket but,<br> strech
    to others hands beside yourself</p>
  <p> When you streach your hands to your friends you are doing great job but,<br>
    when you streach for those who are in needs of your streach hands<br> you are
    showing the reason why you have these two beatiful hands with ten fingers</p>
  <p> The balls we see in each kids hands are given to them by GoodHands Charity</p>
