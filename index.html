  <body>Good Hands was founded by a consortium of retired
    professional athletes, each of whom had
    experienced firsthand, the power of sport
     to transform the lives of young people.

     <p>Through the generous donations of our supporters, contributors,
       and volunteers, Good Hands has provided gear, uniforms, and talented coaches
       to over 7,000 youth, who would not otherwise had the opportunity to participate.
     <p> Good Hands coaches are selected through a competetive process, and undergo rigorous and extensive traing and are uniquely prepared to provide first-rate athletic training and mentorship 
       to Good Hands athletes.</body>
