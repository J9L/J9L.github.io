<p> GoodHands are the Noon Government Organization that was founded by five
   students from the <br> School Of CodeFellows which is located in Portland,
   Oregon.
    GoodHands have many branches and our <br>main goal is to show why we have
     given hands
 Hands are basically given to us not to just put in our pocket but, strech
   to others hands beside yourself.
 When you streach your hands to your friends you are doing great job but,
   when you streach for those who are in needs of your streach hand you are
   showing the reason why you have these two beatiful hands with ten fingers
 The balls we see in each kids hands are given to them by GoodHands Charity
 Good Hands was founded by a consortium of retired
    professional athletes, each of whom had
    experienced firsthand, the power of sport
     to transform the lives of young people.
â€‹Through the generous donations of our supporters, contributors,
       and volunteers, Good Hands has provided gear, uniforms, and talented coaches
       to over 7,000 youth, who would not otherwise had the opportunity to participate.
Good Hands coaches are selected through a competetive process, and undergo rigor
ous and extensive traing and are uniquely prepared to provide first-rate athletic
 training and mentorship to goodhand athletes.</p>
